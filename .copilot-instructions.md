# Project-Specific AI Instructions for LightGroove

## Git Workflow Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT automatically push commits to remote repository.

- ✅ **ALLOWED**: `git add` and `git commit` commands
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: `git push` commands (unless explicitly requested by user)

After committing changes, inform the user that changes are committed locally and wait for explicit instruction to push.

## Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Run `git add -A && git commit -m "message"`
3. **STOP** - Do not push automatically
4. Wait for user to explicitly ask for push

## Reason

User wants to review commits before pushing to remote repository.
