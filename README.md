## Features

### DMX / ArtNet Output
- Sends ArtNet by default (monitor or ArtNet node required)
- Works with any ArtNet-to-DMX interface (e.g., Enttec ODE)
- Universe mapping in `config/artnet.json` (DMX universe 1 → ArtNet universe 0)

### Web UI

**Globals Tab**:
- **Master**: Global intensity control (0-100%) that scales all DMX output in real-time
- **FX BPM**: Control speed of color effects (1-480 BPM)
- **FX Fade**: Smooth color transitions (0-100% of beat interval)

**Buttons Section**:
- **Flash Button**: Press and hold for instant full white override - releases back to previous state
  - Pauses any running color effects during flash
  - Works at startup even without prior configuration (blackout on release)
  - Touch-friendly for mobile devices

**Faders Tab**:
- Compact fixture cards with vertical faders in channel order
- Real-time DMX values (0-255) with live updates
- Responsive layout that adapts to screen width

**Colors Tab**:
- **Static Colors**: 10 preset buttons (Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, White, Orange, Purple, Black)
- **Color FX**: Server-side effects that run independently
  - Random 1: All fixtures display same color, cycles at BPM speed
  - Random 2: Each fixture gets different random color at each beat
  - Random 3: Alternates between even/odd patches with black (strobe effect)
  - Random 4: Chaser effect - one fixture at a time in sequence with random colors
  - Smooth fade transitions blend colors over the beat interval (adjustable via FX Fade)
- Active color and FX button highlighting with multi-color support for Random 2/3/4

**Config Tab**:
- **ArtNet Nodes**: Add, edit, and delete ArtNet output nodes with IP addresses and universes
- **Universe Mapping**: Configure which DMX universe maps to which ArtNet node and universe
- **Colors**: Edit RGBW color definitions (0-1 range) with live preview, add/remove colors
- **Global Settings**: Configure default output mode and FPS
- Changes are saved immediately and automatically reload without server restart

### Connection Monitoring
- Real-time connection status indicator in header (green dot = connected, red pulsing dot = offline)
- Automatic UI recovery when server reconnects
- Seamless continuation of all operations after connection restore
